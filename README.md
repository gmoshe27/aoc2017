# Advent of Code 2017

Solutions in F# for [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

I tried to keep to the following rules:
- The solutions should be mostly functional, use recursion, common data constructs and avoid mutable state where possible
- Don't be dogmatic! Sometimes mutability is useful (like when implementing memory), accept it, but keep it to a local scope
- Dictionaries and Arrays useful because they hold state. Use them where they minimize complexity. This is F# after-all, not Haskel.
- Have fun, and try to learn a thing or two
